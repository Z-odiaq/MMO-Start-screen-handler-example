# MMO Start up screen handler with GeonBit.UI
An MMORPG project called Boris Online i was working which i abandoned like every project i started. 
I scrap some usefull files from it and produce this "Start up" screen that handles login and registration with all checks (Email verification, password length, checkbox.etc).
Using GeonBit.UI on this project with responsive interface was a great experience and i hope it helps anyone working with GeonBit.UI.
